The “4-Queens Problem” consists of placing four queens on a 4 x 4 chessboard so that no two queens can capture each other. That is, no two queens are allowed 
to be placed on the same row, the same column or the same diagonal (both primary and secondary diagonals). Write a C program to simulate the given problem 
and perform the algorithmic complexity analysis for the solution you propose.
